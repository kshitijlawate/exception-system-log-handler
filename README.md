# What is exception-system-log-handler?

It is a combination of 2 utility classes and a custom object that serves 2 purposes. 
1. You can use methods in 'SystemLog' class to log any content in your apex class. This can be ongoing logging of execution flow in code or just one time call to log a specific event/property. 
2. 'ExceptionHelper' class methods can be helpful to extract messages and exception content in catch blocks with single line of code. 

Please check the code in Test classes to understand how to use the utility methods.
